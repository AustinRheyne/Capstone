    <h1>My Capstone</h1>
    <p>
       When I first found out that I needed to create a 
       capstone for my senior year project I became somewhat
       overwhelmed. I knew that I would get an entire year and
       that I was going to spend that time learning and at
       the end would get to portray my knowledge. Now that I
       am a senior I knew what I wanted to do. I wanted to learn
       how to design and deploy a good looking, full scale website
    </p>
    <h1>The Plan:</h1>
        <p>
           First, I began by speaking to my father who also happens to be my
           advocate. He has a good bit of web experience and so I knew that
           he would be able to help me come up with a way to learn all of
           this information. He told me that I need to learn CSS and HTML 
           so that I can speak to the web. I devised a way to learn. I purchased
           a book about HTML & CSS and began watching youtube videos. My favorite
           videos came from a youtube page under the name of 
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw">Web Dev Simplified</a>.
        </p>
    <h1>The Execution:</h1>
        <p>After a few months of watching YouTube videos and reading books, I had created
           quite a few different mini web pages and was ready for a full fledged website.
           I sat down with my dad and created a wireframe for the site. A wireframe is a drawn
           version of the website, depicting what it will looklike and where everything will go.
           My wireframe took about 30 minutes to complete
        </p>
    <h1>The Final:</h1>
    <p>
        Finally, now that I have finished the site, it is clear to see how much I have learned.
        The webpage is complete with a nav-bar on the top which goes into much more detail about
        the various aspects of the capstone. The 'About The Project' section mentions more about
        what I have created here and how it all works. The 'How I Learned' section is a detailed
        explaination of my learning process. The 'My Take Away' section explains what all I believe
        is important about this project and how it may help me in the future. Finally, the contact section
        allows any user to send me an email with questions upon recieving I will respond to them.
