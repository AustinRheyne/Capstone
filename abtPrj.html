    <h1>About The Project</h1>
    <p>
        In order to create the project I had to learn quite a few things. One thing I learned was the importance of planning.
        I pretty quickly realized that when undertaking such a large thing, it has to be planned out well. Another thing I learned
        was how to read propper documentation. When trying to learn how to create a webpage,
        I had to read all sorts of technical docs. Finally, I had to learn how to create concise and well writen code so that it
        would be easy to read and execute
