    <h1>How I Learned</h1>
    <p>
        In order to create such a project I had to learn a lot of stuff. I learned through many mediums. I began by
        asking my dad for some ideas on where to start. He guided me to the following
    </p>
    <h1>YouTube</h1>
    <p>I began on YouTube, where I was able to find several videos that fit my needs. I found hundreds of videos which helped me find out
        how to start. I was walked through how to download an IDE, create my first webpage, and how to think like a programmer. My favorite web development YouTuber is someone
        who goes by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw">Web Dev Simplified</a>
    </p>
    <h1>Documentation</h1>
    <p>The next step in my adventure was to read some docs. This was the most helpful while I was actually creating the site. I believe that documentation is very short
        and sweet, leading to the fastest possible answer at all times. I found that <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools</a> holds the best info for anythin HTML5 and CSS realted.
    </p>
    <h1>Asking Around</h1>
    <p>Finally, I asked for help. It's always a good idea to ask aroud for some help whenever I may need it. So, I enlisted the help of my father as well as some fellow Hilliard Davidson HighSchool students
        named Ryan Zmuda, and Sebastion Simon. The two of them in additon to my father helped me pull everything together nicely so that the page looked the best that it could.
